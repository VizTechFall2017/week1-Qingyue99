     <p> Child-Adult daycare centers are places for communication and learning. In these places, the children who represent the future meet the elderly who already have a wealth of life experiences. The architecture aims to provide a quality physical environment for these two groups to meet and through its design provide more opportunities for them to learn and grow from being with each other during the time they spend here.

    <p>The core of culture is heritage. In the modern society, the damage that happens to the old building is visible, but invisible to the young generation. They grew up with less understanding for the culture and history of the place where they live. Through redesigning Dalotn, has a great cultural value to the residents living in the periphery. Through deisgn, I bring a new energy back, to provide a platform for the exchange of social activities , but also a stop to reflect on their own sense of the space.
